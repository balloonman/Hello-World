The submission uses SDL to animate a character from a sprite sheet in
a simple walking motion. SDL_Surfaces include a screen and a sprite sheet
where the character art lives. An SDL_Rect clips[10] array stores the
offset information for the 10 frames used in the animation. They were found
by manually measuring the height and width of each frame on the sheet, then
using those parameters to iterate over the 10 necessary frames and give them
the appropriate offsets.

A Character class stores abstract information about the "character" being
animated such as its velocity, its current frame (0-9), and its offSet on the
x axis (since the animation only runs side to side). A default constructor
gives the character an arbitrary initial velocity to demonstrate motion and sets
offSet and frame to 0. The Character::move() method
